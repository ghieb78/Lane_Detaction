#  Real-Time Lane Detection on Mobile using ResNet152 + TFLite
This project implements a real-time lane detection system using a modified ResNet152 deep learning model. The trained model is converted to TFLite format and deployed on Android devices via Android Studio, enabling efficient, low-latency lane detection directly on mobile.
# Installation
