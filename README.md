#  Real-Time Lane Detection on Mobile using ResNet152 + TFLite

### Architecture: ResNet152 

### Dataset: TuSimple Preprocessed Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rangalamahesh/preprocessed-1

This project implements a real-time lane detection system using a modified ResNet152 deep learning model. The trained model is converted to TFLite format and deployed on Android devices via Android Studio, enabling efficient, low-latency lane detection directly on mobile.
